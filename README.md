# BlockChain

As a final project for my Computer Science: Data Structures and Algorithms class, I decided to try to implement a basic blockchain to explore cryptography, hash functions, and how blockchains actually work with a mix of SFML for graphics.


Readme will be updated when project is completed with a full description.
