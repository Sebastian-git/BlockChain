# BlockChain

As a final project for my Computer Science: Data Structures and Algorithms class, I decided to try to implement a basic blockchain to explore cryptography, hash functions, and how blockchains actually work with a mix of SFML for graphics.


Readme will be updated when project is completed with a full description.


## Topics that will be included in more detail in the README once the project is done:

- Basic SFML features, new objects like Buttons, TextInputs, and Labels
- Block object, how it distrbutes the "chain" to all clients to prevent fraud
- Sockets (what SFML's .setBlocking() function does, how clients share the blockchain with the server)
- Merckle roots/trees (efficiency compared to just hashing all values)
- Hash functions (asymmetric vs symmetric, SHA256, ECC, Diffie Hellman)
- Explain modular exponentiation, and why its the only reason the RSA code works fast enough
- Proof of work, computer networking, how each node/client verifies transactions
